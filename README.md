Python script to semi-automate payment of large numbers of utility accounts

Shockingly, huge utility companies like Duke Energy make it a complete nightmare to run multiple accounts with separate addresses.  Between our own many office locations and accounts for properties that we manage we have to login hundreds of times each month and this script aims to do that process for us in bulk

Initially it'll be hard coded, then we'll move to a spreadsheet that can be updated by anyone and the script will pull that data in real-time

We will eventually move this to a SQL database with a form our staff can utilize on our internal python flask UI

This project was roughed out in a few minutes as proof of concept (had to see how aggressive anti-bots would be) and is far from complete as of now 10/22/21
